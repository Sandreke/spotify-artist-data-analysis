# spotify-artist-data-analysis


This project aims to perform data analysis and visualization of your favorite artist with [Python](https://www.python.org/) using data from albums (both album and single), album type, release year, songs on albums, artists on songs (there may be collaborations), the length of the songs and the popularity of the songs on [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/).

## ðŸŽ¥ Tutorial: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/AUzmhBq0Mc0)

This is a step by step project that will guide you with the explanation of each part of the [code](https://github.com/Sandreke/spotify-artist-data-analysis/blob/main/pedro-su%C3%A1rez-v%C3%A9rtiz.ipynb)

### ðŸ”Ž Use case: 

As a tribute, an analysis of the musical career of the Peruvian rock singer [Pedro SuÃ¡rez-VÃ©rtiz](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Su%C3%A1rez-V%C3%A9rtiz) was carried out, which addresses both his stage in the band [Arena Hash](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_Hash) and his stage as a soloist. If you want to carry out a similar analysis that involves more than one stage of your artist, I recommend using the following [notebook](https://github.com/Sandreke/spotify-artist-data-analysis/blob/main/pedro-su%C3%A1rez-v%C3%A9rtiz.ipynb):

> *pedro-suÃ¡rez-vÃ©rtiz.ipynb*

On the contrary, if your artist analysis involves only one stage, I recommend using this [notebook](https://github.com/Sandreke/spotify-artist-data-analysis/blob/main/your-favorite-artist.ipynb) since it was created specifically for that purpose:
