# spotify-artist-data-analysis


This project aims to perform data analysis and visualization of your favorite artist with [Python](https://www.python.org/) using data from albums (both album and single), album type, release year, songs on albums, artists on songs (there may be collaborations), the length of the songs and the popularity of the songs on [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/).

## ðŸŽ¥ Tutorial: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/AUzmhBq0Mc0)

This is a step-by-step project that will guide you with the explanation of each part of the [code](https://github.com/Sandreke/spotify-artist-data-analysis/blob/main/pedro-su%C3%A1rez-v%C3%A9rtiz.ipynb).

### ðŸ”‘ Get credentials: 

In order to carry out this project it is necessary to access the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/) to get these 2 necessary credentials. This [tutorial](https://youtu.be/j4J7B1C3G0U) shows easily how to do it.

### ðŸ”Ž Use case: 

As a tribute, an analysis of the musical career of the Peruvian rock singer [Pedro SuÃ¡rez-VÃ©rtiz](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Su%C3%A1rez-V%C3%A9rtiz) was carried out, which addresses both his stage in the band [Arena Hash](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_Hash) and his stage as a soloist. If you want to carry out a similar analysis that involves more than one stage of your artist, I recommend using the following [notebook](https://github.com/Sandreke/spotify-artist-data-analysis/blob/main/pedro-su%C3%A1rez-v%C3%A9rtiz.ipynb):

> *pedro-suÃ¡rez-vÃ©rtiz.ipynb*

On the contrary, if your artist analysis involves only one stage, I recommend using this [notebook](https://github.com/Sandreke/spotify-artist-data-analysis/blob/main/your-favorite-artist.ipynb) since it was created specifically for that purpose:

> *your-favorite-artist.ipynb*

### ðŸ“Š Output: 

After performing data manipulation and analysis, the Plotly library is used to plot a total of 8 graphs like the one below.

It is recommended to watch this [video](https://youtu.be/AUzmhBq0Mc0) to see all the graphs you can make, since they cannot be seen on the notebook because Plotly graphs are not static HTML.
